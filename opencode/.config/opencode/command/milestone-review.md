description: Review a milestone implementation
---

Review the current milestone implementation:
1. check all beads have been completed and work on them if not
2. read the MILESTONE_XXX.md doc and compare it with the implementation
3. review the code change for quality and completeness
4. ensure all features have been integrated with existing systems
5. identify gaps in the implementation and add new beads
6. iterate until all beads are complete
7. when complete push to pr or main and say 'CLEAR! 👻'
