description: Work on a milestone implementation
---

Work on the current milestone:
1. systematically implement all beads
2. check back to the MILESTONE_XXX.md doc for clarification
3. refactor aggressively
4. keep architecture clean
5. heavily unit test and work TDD where possible
6. identify gaps in the implementation and add new beads
7. iterate until all beads are complete
8. when complete say 'YEEHAW! 🤠'
